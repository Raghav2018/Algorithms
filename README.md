Hello All, 

I practice algorithms here. I will update the list as I learn and implement more algorithms.

- Heaps ()

The binary heap data structure is an array object which can be viewed as a nearly completely binary tree. These "nodes' satisfy heap property depending on the kind of heap. In a max-heap, parent node has a value greater than its children. Max-Heapify is the algorithm used to maintain this heap property. Running time on a node of height h takes O(h). Build-Max-Heap algorithm is used to build a heap. Heapsort algorithm runs in O(n lg n) time as call to Build-Max-Heap takes O(n) and each of the n-1 calls to Max-Heapify takes O(lg n)
